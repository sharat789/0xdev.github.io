        <h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I Got Here</h2>
<p>I got into the micro-blogging space 2 years ago when I first started my job as a Frontend Platform Engineer. It all began when I noticed my colleague casually browsing 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacker News</a>
 while sipping his morning coffee‚Äîwhich quickly became my ritual too.</p>
<p>I was impressed by how everyday developers had their own blog websites where they shared knowledge and experience with the world, often with a tinge of humor and sarcasm that made technical content a very nice addition to your daily monotonous task of asking people to rebase their PR when shit doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I Do</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently part of a team that manages the platform for all frontend teams in our company. Our focus is on creating a space where developers can just write code without worrying about the CI/CD process‚Äîgiven they follow the rules and constraints we&rsquo;ve set (almost never happens).</p>
<p>The key areas I thoroughly enjoy in this role include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System Design</strong>: Architecting solutions for an ever-increasing customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Thinking about long-term code health and developer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Discussing how solutions will (or won&rsquo;t) scale gracefully.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-hope-to-achieve">What I Hope to Achieve</h2>
<p>With this blog, I hope to accomplish several things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better Problem Solving</strong>: Forcing myself to think more about certain solutions so that I get more content to share here as every individual writes garbage code but they get to know about it when other people see it.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Communication</strong>: Improve my writing and documentation skills (the ultimate irreplaceable corporate weapon, as we all know).</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Learning</strong>: Maybe when I see the last commit was 6 months ago, a fire will light under my ass to finally finish that project for a new post.</li>
</ol>

<p>As our lord and savior, Linus Torvalds, once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Talk is cheap. Show me the code.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Well, I guess that&rsquo;s all for now. Excited to create more bugs in tech by writing more code every day! üêõ</p>
<p><em>Thanks for spending a few minutes to read this instead of watching youtube pretending to do super important work.</em></p>
